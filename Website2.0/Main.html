    <h4>
        The goal of the website is to make education easier for you! At the moment, 
        we want to be able to provide students resources to better their learning experience.
        With this website, our goal is to make learning as simple as possible! We would provide
        resources for things like university courses such as mathematics, computer science, 
        economics, psychology and much more. We also want to add resources to help other students 
        save money by providing textbook pdf's on the internet and other resources used within their
        courses. 
    </h4>

    <h4>
        Besides the resource aspect of school, we want to provide users with the ability
        to check out playlists that we like, chat with other students from either their
        university or other universities, and connect with one another. This website 
        designed for students and people alike, therefore, it is very community based.
        We love to take feedback from you as we continue to improve our website. Send an
        email to us to add new features and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible!
        Hope you enjoy and have fun! - Hayden
